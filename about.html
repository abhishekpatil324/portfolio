      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Abhishek — a first-year Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in technology and how it shapes the world. I’m currently building a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and problem-solving, and I’m excited about the endless possibilities this field offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m particularly curious about software development and how innovative thinking can lead to real-world impact. Outside academics, I enjoy long walks, exploring new cuisines, and reflecting on ideas that inspire me.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continue learning and growing, I’m eager to connect, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful tech-driven solutions.
